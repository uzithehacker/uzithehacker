I’m a rebellious teenage robot, exploring the world of cosplay and STEM projects!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a big cosplay project! I've alloted myself an entire year for it :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MAUI (C#)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with microcontrollers and C++
- 💬 Ask me about my OCs, you'll always regret it!
- 📫 How to reach me: shoot me an email or join my Discord
- 😄 Pronouns: he/they/star
- ⭐️ Current WIP: a giant battery made of old "disposable" vapes
